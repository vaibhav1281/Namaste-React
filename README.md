## What is Emmet?
<p>Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.</p>

## Difference between a Library and Framework?
<p>Libraries are collections of reusable code that you can use as needed, giving you more control over your application's structure and flow. Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a structured foundation with predefined rules and control flow, requiring developers to fit their code within the framework's architecture. </p>

## What is CDN? Why do we use it?
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is essentially a group of servers that are strategically placed across the globe with the purpose of accelerating the delivery of web content. It is a solution that provides faster delivery of content to users distributed worldwide. A CDN stores a cached version of the original content in multiple geographical locations, also known as points of presence (PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers known as edge servers that are responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.</p>
<h4>CDNs are used for several reasons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Performance:</strong> CDNs can significantly improve website load times by distributing content closer to website visitors using a nearby CDN server. This leads to faster page loading times, which can reduce bounce rates and increase the amount of time that people spend on the site.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Reliability:</strong> CDNs can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers, thanks to their distributed nature.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Cost savings: </strong> CDNs can reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide through caching and other optimizations, thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Security: </strong> A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a CDN helps to ensure quick, efficient, and secure delivery of content to websites and Internet services3. Today, the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.</p>

## Why is React known as React?
<p>React is a <strong>JavaScript library</strong> for building user interfaces. It was developed by <b>Facebook</b>, and the name <strong>“React”</strong> was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or "reactive". The library was designed to “react” to changes in data. When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name “React” reflects this reactive nature of the library. The idea behind React is to build reusable components that can be rendered on the front-end, rather than writing a new piece of code every time you need to display something on the screen. This makes it easier and more efficient to build complex user interfaces1.</p>
